# Kirby's Return to Dream Land for Archipelago

An Archipelago .apworld implementation for Kirby's Return to Dream Land.

This readme isn't done yet so plenty of info will be missing.



# Supported versions

Currently the only tested (and supported) hash of the game is the US release (Kirby's Return to Dream Land, not Kirby's Adventure Wii or Hoshi no Kābī Wii) in an RVZ format.

Dolphin allows the user to convert ISO, GCZ, WIA and RVZ files between different formats by right clicking the entry in the games menu and then clicking the "Convert File" option. In this menu you simply want to convert it to RVZ with the default settings if your file is not already an RVZ file, then place the RVZ in your Archipelago file path.

Due to the nature of the file type, WBFS is likely not supported even if restored back to being an ISO.

This implementation does not support the Deluxe version for Nintendo Switch.
